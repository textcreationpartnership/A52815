            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Full and True ACCOUNT Of the Late BLAZING-STAR: With Å¿ome probable PrognoÅ¿ticks upon what may be its Effects.</head>
            <p>ABlazing Star is called a <hi>Comet</hi> from the Latin word <hi>Coma,</hi> the Hair, becauÅ¿e it Å¿eemeth to Å¿end forth Streamers of flaming Hair to thoÅ¿e that behold it a far off. There be various Opinions of Authors concerning thoÅ¿e <hi>Comets:</hi> Å¿ome whereof are Å¿o improbable, that only to report them, is enough to refute them. As, 1. <hi>Democritus</hi> dreamed that <hi>Comets</hi> were the Souls of famous Men triumphing in Heaven. 2. <hi>Thaddeus</hi> thinketh that they are the Secrets of Nature, and (like the occult Quality of PhiloÅ¿ophers) ought not to be enquired after. 3. <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celÅ¿us</hi> Å¿uppoÅ¿eth that they are Fires carried about by Spirits which are conÅ¿cious of their own Fates. 4. <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> imagines them to be a Conjunct Apparition of Planets; becauÅ¿e when Planets come near together they Å¿eem to touch one another, and that Conjunction of 2 or 3 Lights into one, cauÅ¿eth the <hi>Phoenomenon,</hi> or Appearance of a longer Star; which by varying its Place, varieth its Form alÅ¿o. 5, <hi>Appianus</hi> and <hi>Proetorius</hi> (both) acknowledge that <hi>Comets</hi> are Meteors, or Vapours exhaled, yet deny that they are inflamed, or fer on fire in their own Bodily Matter, but only enlightned by the Refract Rays of the Sun and other Stars, both upon its Body and Tail. 6. But this laÅ¿t Opinion of <hi>AriÅ¿totle</hi> is moÅ¿t probable; that a <hi>Comet</hi> is a Fiery Meteor made up of Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ViÅ¿cous and Fat Vapours, drawn up into the higheÅ¿t Region of the Air by the influence of the Sun and Stars; and then when it is ripened, taketh Fire, and Å¿hineth in the Figure of a Star, to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34862:2"/>the AÅ¿toniÅ¿hment of all its Beholders. BeÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e (properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) <hi>Comets</hi> engendred in the Elementary Region, it is Å¿uppoÅ¿ed there be Å¿ome other new Stars Å¿ometimes Å¿een above the Moon in the Aetherial Region, Å¿uch as that which appeared in <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿iopoea,</hi> in the Year 1574. every way like a Star in Form and Light, Å¿ave only its Splendor and Magnitude exceeded the greateÅ¿t of Planets. This could not properly be called a <hi>Comet:</hi> 1. BecauÅ¿e it removed not from that Point of Heaven wherein it firÅ¿t appeared, but kept conÅ¿tant in the ConÅ¿tellation till it diÅ¿appeared. 2. BecauÅ¿e it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in view for a whole Year, and more than a Quarter. 3. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e it had neither Hair nor Tail or Train, as <hi>Comets</hi> have; which likewiÅ¿e remove from one part of Heaven to another, and never continue Å¿o long as that did. 'Tis not improbable that Å¿uch new Stars God (for a time) withdraws from Men's Å¿ight, that the Sign of his <hi>Anger</hi> or <hi>Favour</hi> might be the more admired: For theÅ¿e do not waÅ¿te away, as (properly called) <hi>Comets</hi> do; but only lie hid from the Eye, Å¿eeing Heaven cannot admit of new Bodies. That Star which appeared to the Wife Men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. was not a Natural, but a Miraculous Star. 1. BecauÅ¿e it Å¿hone not in the CeleÅ¿tial, but in the Elementary Region; yea, in the loweÅ¿t part of it, Å¿o as to guide the three Men to a certain HouÅ¿e over which it Å¿tood. 2. BecauÅ¿e it had not the Motion of a Natural Star, but Å¿uch as was Accommodated every way to the Travel of the WiÅ¿e Men. 3. Its ProgreÅ¿s was unequal, Å¿ometimes <hi>Appearing,</hi> and Å¿ometimes <hi>DiÅ¿appearing.</hi> 4. It did not only Å¿hine forth by <hi>Night,</hi> but alÅ¿o by <hi>Day.</hi> Yea, 5. With Å¿uch a Splendour, as far exceeded, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the Stars, but alÅ¿o the Sun it Å¿elf; as <hi>Ignatius, ChriÅ¿oÅ¿tom, &amp;c.</hi> do teÅ¿tifie. Some Å¿ay, that Star in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. was the Holy GhoÅ¿t which appeared (at ChriÅ¿t's BaptiÅ¿m) in the Form of a <hi>Dove,</hi> as at his Birth in the Form of a Star, being moÅ¿t ConÅ¿entaneous to thoÅ¿e EaÅ¿tern Sages: For as a mighty Draught of FiÅ¿h was the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t Sign to make <hi>Peter</hi> (a FiÅ¿her-man) to follow ChriÅ¿t, Å¿o this Sign of a Star was beÅ¿t accommodated to theÅ¿e Men of the EaÅ¿t, it being moÅ¿t familiar to them in their frequent Study of the Stars. But more probably <hi>ChriÅ¿oÅ¿tom</hi> judgeth it was an Angel [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>] a certain inviÅ¿ible Power to be the Guide of their Journey, as the Pillar of Glory was <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi>'s in the WilderneÅ¿s, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34862:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>22. Yea, Å¿ome do affirm that it was the Å¿ame Angel who appeared alÅ¿o to the Shephards, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.9. But the Elementary <hi>Comets</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in any proper SenÅ¿e) be called Stars (though their common Name be Blazing Stars.) BecauÅ¿e, 1. They have a different Form, no way congruous to that of Stars. 2. They grow Greater and LeÅ¿Å¿er. 3. They have an Uncertain and Vagabond Motion. 4. Their Matter is an Hot and Dry Exhalation, which is Slimy and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous; and which being Å¿pent, they vaniÅ¿h away: ThoÅ¿e things hold no Congruity with proper Stars. PhiloÅ¿ophy Å¿aith, that thoÅ¿e <hi>Comets</hi> are compoÅ¿ed of a Matter full of Mettalline or Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vapours, which is both thruÅ¿t out of the Bowels of the Earth by an Internal Heat from the Subterraneous Spirits, and extracted thence alÅ¿o by an External Heat from the CeleÅ¿tial Bodies; whereby likewiÅ¿e it is drawn up into the Upper Region. One part of this Fuliginous Smoak, thruÅ¿ting up, and cleaving cloÅ¿e to another, till it become as big as a Mountain, then it hangs pendulouÅ¿ly, and mellows kindly into a CombuÅ¿tible SubÅ¿tance. Then takes it fire; and the Colour of that Star by whoÅ¿e force it is Generated and Governed: And when all this is done, though it be of a vaÅ¿t Magnitude, yet through the great DiÅ¿tance of Place<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> it Å¿eems to us as a very little Spangle or Spur-Rowel, if Å¿evered from its Train or Streamer. Touching theÅ¿e Comets, TheÅ¿e four things are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally conÅ¿iderable after their Product or Generation. 1. Their <hi>Form.</hi> 2. Their <hi>Colour.</hi> 3. Their <hi>Motion.</hi> 4. Their <hi>Signification.</hi> 1. Of their <hi>Form,</hi> which is various: one <hi>Comet</hi> hath a <hi>Beard,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Tail,</hi> and a third is <hi>Hairy</hi> round about. This flows from the Flame of the fired Vapour diverÅ¿ly diÅ¿perÅ¿ed. 1. If it Å¿pread its Flame upon its former part, then it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Barbatus,</hi> a Bearded <hi>Comet,</hi> as having the Flame (as a Man's Beard, or a HorÅ¿es Main) hanging downward. 2. If from the latter part the Flame Å¿putter out behind, following after the Body, then it is called <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datus,</hi> a Tailed <hi>Comet.</hi> But 3. If it Å¿pit Fire from all parts round about, then is it called <hi>Crinitus,</hi> an Hairy <hi>Comet,</hi> when it is Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Rays of Fire, as the BuÅ¿hy Head is with Hair. Thus the diverÅ¿ity of Flames produceth diverÅ¿ity of Forms in them, yet moÅ¿tly Å¿uch as have Trains or Tails; for the hinder part (being not Å¿o compact as the former) Å¿ooneÅ¿t taketh Fire, and Å¿putters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34862:3"/>out a Flame (as we Å¿ee in Squibs or Fuzzees) like a long BeÅ¿om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or the Tail of a Peacock. 2. Of their <hi>Colour,</hi> which DiÅ¿tinction they derive from the Dominion of the Planet in their Generation, which may eaÅ¿ily be diÅ¿cerned by their various Colours. <hi>Comets</hi> have their Dusky and Leaden Colour from <hi>Saturn,</hi> Splendid from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Fiery from <hi>Mars,</hi> Golden from the <hi>Sun,</hi> Silver from the <hi>Moon,</hi> Yellow from <hi>Venus,</hi> and of changeable Colours from <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury:</hi> And all theÅ¿e various Colours are Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be various In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of differing Natures, as the Planets (from whence they derive them) do differ in their Natures and Influences one from another. 3. Of their <hi>Motion. Comets</hi> are of an Erratick Motion, as the new Stars immitate the fixed Stars, Å¿o do <hi>Comets</hi> immitate the Planets in their Motions: Some are moved according to the Motion of the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> (to Å¿peak <hi>ex HypotheÅ¿i</hi>) to wit, from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t; but Å¿ome Å¿lowlier fulfilling that Motion, and others more Å¿wiftly exceeding it. Their Motion is therefore called Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, becauÅ¿e it is not Regular and Certain, as that of the fixed Stars is, whoÅ¿e RiÅ¿ing and Setting are certainly known; but the Motion of Comets is Å¿ometimes nearer, and Å¿ometimes further off from the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> as the Motion of the Planets is: Yet not altogether as the Planets, which never remove far from the <hi>Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,</hi> but have always certain and well known Bounds of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: whereas <hi>Comets</hi> have an Irregular Motion, and (as to the <hi>Zodiack</hi>) plainly Eccentrick, wandring far from it in their remote Appearances; and though Motion from EaÅ¿t to WeÅ¿t be Regular, yet this happens by Accident, only becauÅ¿e the Upper Region of the Air (wherein <hi>Comets</hi> are both Engendred and Fired) is whirl'd about with the Heavens; hence the Comet therein wheels about with it. 4. Of their <hi>Signification.</hi> The principal thing intended, to wit, the PrognoÅ¿ticks of them. 'Tis true, there be Å¿ome who deny altogether their Significancy; as <hi>EraÅ¿tus, Gryneus,</hi> and others: but 'tis too too manifeÅ¿t that <hi>Comets</hi> are not mute things, but that they are Signs which God placeth in Heaven, to preach Å¿omething to Men on Earth. No Man in his right Mind can Å¿ay, that the moÅ¿t wiÅ¿e God doth make any thing in vain, or that the Father of Lights Å¿hould hang out Å¿uch a Å¿trange and Å¿tupendious Light
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34862:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>up aloft (to be Å¿een far and wide) and this not to portend Å¿ome extraordinary thing. ConÅ¿ult Antiquity, there is found. 1. That Greek Proverb, [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>,] <hi>There is no Comet which brings not Å¿ome Evil.</hi> 2. That VerÅ¿e of <hi>Manilius,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>[Nunquam Futilibus ReÅ¿plenduit Ignibus Aether.]</q>

               </gap>] or proper Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the praedominant Planet is eaÅ¿ily diÅ¿cerned by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion or colour of the Comet: If it be red, it borrows that colour from <hi>Mars,</hi> which is predominant in its Generation: if dull and dusky, then 'tis <hi>Saturnine</hi> as before, and Å¿o of the reÅ¿t, and as they have the like <hi>Colour</hi> with this or that Planet, Å¿o they have the like <hi>Influence.</hi> The 5th Rule is, Comets have their Significations from the Signs of the Zodiack wherein they are Å¿cituated, as if they appear in the Watery Signs, they portend Famine and Plague, if in the Airy Signs, the follow furious Storms and Fractions or Factions; If in the Fiery Sign, then Fire and Sword Å¿ticceed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The 6th. Rule is, the Å¿ignificancy of Comets is drawn from their differing PoÅ¿itions to the Sun, for a Morning or Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Comet portendeth the Death of Å¿ome Prince, but the EaÅ¿tern Comet preÅ¿ageth a quicker accompliÅ¿hment and diÅ¿patch of Å¿uch a Royal Death than doth a WeÅ¿tern one. The 7th. Rule is, PrognoÅ¿ticks of Comets are further taken from their <hi>Motion:</hi> If the Comet be without motion, and be fixed in one point of the Heavens (as that over <hi>JeruÅ¿alem</hi> was, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before its DeÅ¿truction) it denotes Å¿ome long and laÅ¿ting evil; if it be moveable from one Sign to another, 'tis an Indication of Commotions,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34862:10"/>Wars, and (perhaps) of Civil Wars. If it move faÅ¿t and Å¿oon decay, 'tis a Sign Gods Wrath will come Å¿hortly and be Å¿hort though it be Å¿harp. The 8th. Rule is drawn from the magnitude and form of the Comet, as well as from its Duration, for the greater that a Comet is, and the longer that it continueth, the more horrible are its effects and indications; if alÅ¿o its form or figure be with a Tail or Train, then it (as with a finger) pointeth out thereby that <hi>Evil</hi> is denounced againÅ¿t thoÅ¿e Countries, eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially towards which its BruÅ¿h or Tail is extended, and the longer that the Train is, the longer will that evil be upon them: The 9th. Rule is borrowed from the CeleÅ¿tial HouÅ¿es wherein the Comet appeareth, for Comets are moÅ¿t obnoxious to thoÅ¿e Countries over which they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vertical, or in whoÅ¿e Signs they are moÅ¿t Å¿een: And to mention no more of thoÅ¿e CeleÅ¿tial Signs or HouÅ¿es (wherein this Comet is Å¿aid to appear in its Retrograde motion,) AÅ¿trological Rules place. 1. <hi>Norway, Bavaria, Fez,</hi> &amp;c. under <hi>Scorpio,</hi> in which Sign this Blazing-Star is Å¿aid to have its firÅ¿t riÅ¿e. 2. <hi>Spain, Hungary,</hi> &amp;c. under <hi>Sagittary.</hi> 3. <hi>Grece, Lithuania, Saxony,</hi> &amp;c. under <hi>Capricorn.</hi> 4. <hi>Tartary, RuÅ¿Å¿ia, Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp;c. under <hi>Aquarius.</hi> 5. <hi>Portugal, Galitia, Normandy</hi> under <hi>PiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> 6. <hi>England, France, Germany</hi> under <hi>Aries:</hi> I mention no more but theÅ¿e 6 HouÅ¿es of Heaven (omitting the other 6,) becauÅ¿e Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors have obÅ¿erved this preÅ¿ent Comet hath had Å¿ome Å¿hort reÅ¿idence in all theÅ¿e 6 CeleÅ¿tial Signs or HouÅ¿es, firÅ¿t in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and laÅ¿t in <hi>Aries,</hi> Å¿o that according to AÅ¿trological Rules) all thoÅ¿e Countries and Cities which are placed under thoÅ¿e 6 Signs aforenamed Å¿hall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and infected with the force and influence of this Blazing-Star, not only this and that Land, but even all thoÅ¿e Lands over which it appeared, having extender it Å¿elf over the greateÅ¿t part of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as other parts of the World, and perhaps its effects may begin in thoÅ¿e Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries over which its appearance (or rather exiÅ¿tence) began: while this Comet was in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> though it then did exiÅ¿t, yet could it not appear, being then hid in the Beams of the Sun, yet going down before the Sun, and Å¿hooting its Rays and Stream of Fire (as it were) againÅ¿t the Sun, which poÅ¿ture of a Comet (Å¿tay AÅ¿trologers) doth always portend the Fall of great men, but this Comet having its Retrograde motion into, and Å¿ome Å¿hort Å¿tay and Å¿cituation in thoÅ¿e 6 Å¿everal diÅ¿tinct Signs (the Sun oven-running it, and leaving it every Night farther and farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind it) muÅ¿t have likewiÅ¿e Å¿ome Å¿everal and diÅ¿tinct Effects and Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ticks, for (according to the Rules of this Art) a Comet 1. in <hi>Scorpio</hi> PrognoÅ¿ticateth Wars and Worldly Changes, Drought and Dearth, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery by Land, Piracy by Sea, MiÅ¿carriage of Women with Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. a Comet in <hi>Sagittary</hi> Å¿ignifies LoÅ¿Å¿es, CroÅ¿Å¿es to Great men, great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about Civil and Sacred things, malignant Feavers, and much Mortality. 3. In <hi>Capricorn,</hi> it portends Murders, MaÅ¿Å¿acres, Thefts, Plague and Famine, Death of Princes by PoyÅ¿on, all DeÅ¿pite againÅ¿t Religion and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34862:10"/>the Religious. 4. In <hi>Aquarius,</hi> a Comet preÅ¿ages long Wars, great Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, Terrible Thunders and Lightnings, Famine, PeÅ¿tilence, Rot and Murrain. 5.

Now this preÅ¿ent Comet having had its Stage and Theatre in all thoÅ¿e 6 aforeÅ¿aid Signs, may poÅ¿Å¿ibly PrognoÅ¿ticate all thoÅ¿e evils aforeÅ¿aid to befal Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e Regions Å¿eated under all thoÅ¿e Signs which it hath run through betwixt its riÅ¿e in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and its failure in <hi>Aries.</hi> According to my beÅ¿t Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, this Comet took its fiÅ¿t Flame by the <hi>hot Beams</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was gone out of the Sign <hi>Scorpio</hi>) wherewith it hard its Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wherein it had its abÅ¿conding (for Å¿ome time from the Sight of men, and likewiÅ¿e it loÅ¿t its laÅ¿t Flame(according to my Å¿trict ObÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) by the <hi>cold Beams</hi> of the <hi>Moon,</hi> even the Half Moon, wherewith it met about the middle of this Month <hi>January:</hi> Foreign Letters do fully teÅ¿tify that this Comet waded out of the Sun-beams (wherein it firÅ¿t lay hid) much Å¿ooner in other Countreys beyond Sea, than it did in our Land, Å¿o that it muÅ¿t have its <hi>ExiÅ¿tence</hi> (if not its <hi>Appearance</hi> in the Month of <hi>November,</hi> continuing all <hi>December</hi> until the 16 of <hi>January,</hi> the Time of its <hi>DiÅ¿appearance.</hi> This Comet (beÅ¿ides its <hi>Diurnal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wherein the Sun (that race-running Champion) did daily over-run it) had its <hi>Retrograde motion,</hi> wherein it marcheth backward farther and farther on the EaÅ¿t Å¿ide from the Sun, and neerer to our <hi>Zenith,</hi> or point of the Heavens directly over our heads, before the attaining of which point it vaniÅ¿hed out of Å¿ight; Å¿o that is this backward motion it fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a marvellous courÅ¿e, from nigh to <hi>Cor Scorpij</hi> (where it had its firÅ¿t being and beginning in this Northern HemiÅ¿phere.

            <p>A more particular DeÅ¿cription both of the Star it Å¿elf, and of its Train Å¿eemeth neceÅ¿Å¿ary to the fuller <hi>Explication,</hi> before we can come to the <hi>Application</hi> of All, and 1, concerning the <hi>Star it Å¿elf,</hi> I do find it was a <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> found in various Complexions, which perhaps its Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Paralaxis or differing Å¿cituations might occaÅ¿ion. The firÅ¿t Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we had of it, was from the Mathematick ProfeÅ¿Å¿or at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> who Å¿aith he took his proÅ¿pect of it in his Tube, and there in Å¿aw the Comet (it Å¿elf) to be fiery and glowing like the flames of a Bakers Oven 2. Other ArtiÅ¿ts (that have viewed it by their TeleÅ¿copes) Å¿ay they Å¿aw it of a bright, Å¿plendid colour; as the former AÅ¿pect was from <hi>Mars,</hi> and Å¿o it was a Martial Star (which it might well be, while it had the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the firÅ¿t Sign, wherein it firÅ¿t exiÅ¿ted, for <hi>Cor Scorpij</hi> hath the Å¿ame complexion with the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> of a red and fiery colour) Å¿o this latter was from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which made the Comet a Jovial Star, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Jovial or Joyful things, as the former doth War and Blood-Å¿hed, The 3d. Accompt we have from Foreign Mathematicians is, that at its firÅ¿t appearance it had a mixture of divers colours, which it borrow'd from <hi>Mercury,</hi> Å¿o became a Mercurial Star, and betokening a mixture of differing DiÅ¿penÅ¿ations, of good as well as of evil; but the 4th. and moÅ¿t univerÅ¿al ProÅ¿pect of it was, that it hath been of a dusky and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en complexion from its firÅ¿t appearance to its laÅ¿t diÅ¿appearance, this colour it borrows from <hi>Saturn</hi> (as is Å¿aid before) and makes it a Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Star, of the moÅ¿t Å¿ullen influence of all the three other Planets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed; Å¿o that no leÅ¿s than 4 Planets are (as it were) called in to the compoÅ¿ition of this Comet, and though Å¿ome doubt may be made concerning the 3 former, to wit, <hi>Mars, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> yet none can queÅ¿tion this laÅ¿t the 4th. of them, inaÅ¿much as many Millions of eye-witneÅ¿Å¿es do unanimouÅ¿ly concur that for a long time to its laÅ¿t ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiÅ¿hing, it had no other complexion but that of <hi>Saturn,</hi> the Å¿ignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation whereof cannot be good, as the Satyrical Poet repreÅ¿ents him in this HexaÅ¿tich.</p>
